X3 Profile Manager
==================

Manage save game profiles for Egosoft's X3 family of games (Reunion, Terran Conflict, Albion Prelude).  This tool allows the user to switch X3 profiles so that you can maintain multiple profiles with all of their corresponding save games.

For example, start as Argon and create save games.  Then use the X3 Profile Manager tool to create a new profile.  Then you can start the game over as Terran or a different race and create many saves with that profile.  You can do this as many times as you like, as well as switching back to any of the profiles you've already created.

Please see the User-Guide.md from the installation for additional information.
