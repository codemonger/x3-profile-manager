USAGE INSTRUCTIONS
The application requires the identification of an X3 game already installed on the computer running the application.  Choose 'Configure' to select an X3 game title and 'Verify' its presence.  Once the presence of the selected title has been verified, click Accept.  You will be directed to name the first Profile - the currently active profile of the X3 game selected.  Click OK to continue.  You may now add additional profiles.


FEATURES
A profile is a collection of save game data and settings created by an X3 game and need not be associated with a unique user for each individual profile.  All profiles may be owned by a single user - e.g. the owner of the X3 game.  The application enables users to alternate between active profiles for running under an X3 game title, and supports the backup, restore, and deletion of individual profiles.  Warning: restoring and deleting a profile will overwrite game save data created under the profile being restored or deleted.  The application provides for only a single backup of each profile to exist at anytime.  Subsequent backups of the same profile will overwrite any previous backups.  A backup of a profile backs up all data files associated with a selected profile.  Users are not permitted to delete any currently active profiles.  That is, a profile must be de-activated before deleting the profile.


FAQ
Q: Why can't I delete my profile?
A: The profile to be deleted cannot be the currently active profile.  Activate another profile then delete the previously activated profile.

Q: The application crashes when I try to activate, backup, restore, or delete a profile. Why?
A: Close Windows Explorer and any other applications (such as Internet browsers, image viewers, etc.) that may be accessing or using files found in the user profiles area of an X3 game.  Try closing all applications and reattempting the profile activation.

Q: How many profiles can I create for a given X3 title?
A: There is no current limitation.  However, each unique user is advised to own a personal copy of the X3 title being managed by the application.
